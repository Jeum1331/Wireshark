## Wireshark: Ultimate Hands-On Course Practice

# üõ† About This Repository

This repository documents my hands-on practice with Wireshark. Based on the Wireshark Ultimate Hands-On Course, this project showcases my learning journey, packet analysis techniques, and practical applications of network forensics.

# üîç Skills Practiced

Packet Capturing & Filtering: Capturing live network traffic and applying display filters.

Protocol Analysis: Understanding and analyzing protocols like TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, ARP, ICMP, and TLS.

Security & Threat Detection: Identifying network anomalies, suspicious packets, and potential cybersecurity threats.

Performance Troubleshooting: Diagnosing network issues such as high latency, packet loss, and congestion.

Custom Filters & Expressions: Writing Wireshark display and capture filters for targeted analysis.

Exporting & Reporting: Extracting and interpreting packet data for documentation and reporting.

# üìÇ Repository Contents

Packet Captures (.pcap files): Sample network traffic captures with annotations.

Filtering Cheat Sheet: Useful Wireshark filter expressions for efficient packet analysis.

Case Studies & Findings: Documented real-world network issues and security threats identified through Wireshark.

Custom Wireshark Profiles: Pre-configured color rules and display filters for different analysis scenarios.

Scripts & Automation: Python scripts leveraging pyshark for automated packet inspection.
